# Vue Custom Range Slider Component for Volume or Audio/Video progress control.
This is a default range slider alternative for volume/video/audio progress control created with **Vue Js**. Stop using input type="range" for volume or audio/video progress control in a audio/video platform. 
To help you, I made a **Custom Range Slider Component** in Vue 3 with 
it's powerful composition API. You can customize the look, widths, heights, colors and even show/hide any parts based on your needs, in short you can customize anything
without even editing the component itself.

### See examples here: [Vue Custom Range Slider Examples](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vue-custom-range-slider-example)

## How to use it?

It's so easyüòÅ Just download or copy the component from the ***src*** folder and put it in your project. Then simply import the component and use it as like any other vue js components. 

## Getting value and setting it

You can use **v-model** directive on the component
to get the slider position value and use it to set the volume or video/audio progress as per your need. You'll get more clear idea if you visit the example above.

## Available Props:
```rangeContainerHeight``` - Set the height of the range slider container. ``default: 7px``.
<br>**NOTE:** Set the height bigger than the range slider height. since it's the background of the slider and will be used for hover effect/animation<br><br>
```rangeHeight``` - Set the height of the range slider itself. ``default: 3px``.<br><br>
```thumbHeight``` - Set the height of the thumb indicator. ``default: 200%``.<br>
**NOTE:** Remember to use percentage value to keep the ratios<br><br>
```rangeBgColor``` - Range Slider background color. ``default: `rgba(100, 100, 100, .5)` ``<br>
```thumbColor``` - Thumb Indicator color. ``default: `red` ``<br>
```previewColor``` - Preview Bar Color. ``default: rgb(150, 150, 150)``.<br>
```progressColor``` - Progress Bar Color(Main Indicator). ``default: red``.<br><br>
```expandOnHover``` - hover effect animation as like in youtube video player. ``default: false``.<br><br>
```AlwaysShowThumb``` - show the thumb indicator always. ``default: false``.<br>
```showCustomText``` - show Custom text inside progress bar. ``default: "0%"``.<br>
```noPreviewBar``` - hide the preview indicator. ``default: false``.<br>
```noProgressBar``` - hide the Progress/Main Indicator bar. ``default: false``.<br>
```noThumb``` - hide the thumb indicator always. ``default: false``.<br><br>

## Providing a default position:
This is simple. add a v-model directive and pass the default value in the reactive variable itself. <br><br>
**Example:** <br>
> **Defining the varibale:** ```const value = ref(0.4)```<br>
**Usage in the component:** ```<custom-range-slider v-model="value"></custom-range-slider>``` <br><br>
<b> This an extremly needed feature. Sometimes we want to set a default progress position from the server or browser localstorage. Imagine you want to add a continue watching feature to your ```Audio/Video``` file or maybe you want to give the users the ability to set the volume once and even after reloading the page the volume should not change. </b>
