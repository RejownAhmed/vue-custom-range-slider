# Vue Custom Volume/Video/Audio Progress/Range Slider Component
This is browser built in range slider alternative created with **Vue Js**. Stop using input type="range" for volume or audio/video progress control in a audio/video platform. 
There are many custom indicator with html/css but one of the biggest fallback is that they are not reusable. 
You have to add, edit the whole source file to do simple changes. So, I made a **Custom Progress Control** Component in Vue 3 with 
it's powerful composition API. You can customize the look, widths, heights, colors and even show/hide elements based on your needs, in short you can customize anything
without even editing the component itself.

### See examples here: [Examples](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vue-custom-range-slider-example)

## How to use it?

It's so easyüòÅ Just download or copy the component from the ***src*** folder and put it in your project. Then simply import the component and use it as like any other vue js components. 

## Getting the progress value and setting it as needed

You can use **v-model** directive on the component
to get the slider position value and use it to set the volume or video/audio progress as per your need. You'll get more clear idea if you visit the example above.
