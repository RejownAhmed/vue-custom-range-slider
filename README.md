# Vue Custom Range Slider Component for Volume or Audio/Video progress control.
This is a default range slider alternative created with **Vue Js**. Stop using input type="range" for volume or audio/video progress control in a audio/video platform. 
To help you, I made a **Custom Range Slider Component** in Vue 3 with 
it's powerful composition API. You can customize the look, widths, heights, colors and even show/hide any parts based on your needs, in short you can customize anything
without even editing the component itself.

### See examples here: [Vue Custom Range Slider Examples](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vue-custom-range-slider-example)

## How to use it?

It's so easyüòÅ Just download or copy the component from the ***src*** folder and put it in your project. Then simply import the component and use it as like any other vue js components. 

## Getting the progress value and setting it as needed

You can use **v-model** directive on the component
to get the slider position value and use it to set the volume or video/audio progress as per your need. You'll get more clear idea if you visit the example above.

## Available Props:
```id``` - It is required. Must be unique for each instance loaded. <br>
```defaultPosition``` - You can set a previous/default progress already. ```default: 0``` **NOTE:** it's type is number. So, pass float/integer but no string. And it must be between 0 to 1<br>
```rangeContainerHeight``` - Set the height of the range slider container. ``default: 7px``.(This will be needed for the expand-on-hover effect)<br>
```rangeHeight``` - Set the height of the range slider itself. ``default: 3px``.<br>
```thumbHeight``` - Set the height of the thumb indicator. ``default: 200%``.(Remember to use percentage to keep the ratios)<br>
```rangeBgColor``` - Range Slider background color. ``default: `rgba(100, 100, 100, .5)` ``<br>
```thumbColor``` - Thumb Indicator color. ``default: `red` ``<br>
```previewColor``` - Preview Bar Color. ``default: rgb(150, 150, 150)``.<br>
```progressColor``` - Progress Bar Color(Main Indicator). ``default: red``.<br>
```expandOnHover``` - Declare to add the hover effect animation as like in youtube video player. ``default: false``.<br>

```AlwaysShowThumb``` - Declare to show the thumb indicator always. This removes the hover effect by default. ``default: false``.<br>
```noPrevieBar``` - Declare to hide the preview indicator. ``default: false``.<br>
```noProgressBar``` - Declare to hide the Progress/Main Indicator bar. ``default: false``. in some rare cases it can come in handy<br>
```noThumb``` - Declare to hide the thumb indicator always. ``default: false``.<br>
