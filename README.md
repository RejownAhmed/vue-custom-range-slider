# Custom Volume/Video-Audio Progress indicator
This is browser built in range slider alternative created with **Vue Js**. Stop using input type="range" for volume or audio/video progress control in a audio/video platform. 
There are many custom indicator with html/css but one of the biggest fallback is that they are not reusable. 
You have to add, edit the whole source file to do simple changes. So, I made a **Custom Progress Control** Component in Vue 3 with 
it's powerful composition API. You can customize the look, widths, heights, colors and even show/hide elements based on your needs, in short you can customize anything
without even editing the component itself.

### See examples here: [Examples](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vue-custom-range-slider-example)

## How to use it?

Okay, so you have downloaded the component from the src folder. Now it's time to use it properly.

It's so easy😁 Just import the component and use it as like any other vue js components. 

You can use **v-model** directive on the component
to get the percent value and use it to set the volume or video/audio progress as per your need. 


Thank you for downloading and using this. Hope it helps. Let me know if really helped you😊💖
